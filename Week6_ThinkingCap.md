What are your thoughts on "thick mapping in the digital humanities," and how does it differ from "mapping?"
How does the theory of "thick mapping" inform narratives that are influencing your life?

Before, when I think about mapping, I would always have this singular perspective that mapping is about converting data points to markers on a map, and that would be mapping. After taking GIS and Digital Humanities classes and reading _HyperCitie_, however, I realized that mapping is nowhere neare singular.
