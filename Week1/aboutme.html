        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is Haiqi and I am a junior double-majoring in Art History and French and minoring in Digital Humanities. I am from Shenzhen, China. My <b>goal</b> for this course is to become familiar with web programming and web mapping.</p>
        <p>My <i>interests</i> lie in the environment, sustainability, human rights, and the arts. Here is the <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/335a64ce253d46d4a19a7a125f8f58f7"target="_blank">link</a> to the storymap I created for last quarter.</p>
