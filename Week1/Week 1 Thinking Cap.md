__What is the site's agenda?__

This website uses complex technology to create a map that shows the world's coastal geomorphic zones and the ecosystems. It also provides the latest updates regarding advances in research technologies, etc.

__Why does this website “speak” to you?__

I find it amazing how detailed the map is because it allows us to zoom in and see the composition of different coastal regions. Its legends and coloring are also clear and straightforward for people to understand what they are looking at. We can toggle to turn the Geomorphic and Benthic Maps on and off. The map also leaves out areas that are not coastal, so the whole map appears less distracting. 
One fascinating feature that I found on this website is that it allows us to select a small region and it will automatically calculate the percentage of different geomorphic zones and benthic classes that make up that area. There is also a ruler function that allows us to measure a certain distance or area.

__How does the mapping work, and does it “work?” i.e., in your opinion, does it do what it’s supposed to do?__

There is a detailed description of how the map was created on the website, which can be found [here](https://allencoralatlas.org/methods/). According to the website:

> It all starts with 3.7m satellite imagery. With this data in hand, distorting “noise” in the imagery is taken out. Algorithms then correct for the effects of the atmosphere and sun glint on the surface of the water, and then depth is calculated. Next, field data is used to calibrate rule sets before generating a habitat map with machine learning. The resulting map is then displayed on the Allen Coral Atlas website, and the Atlas Engagement team works with scientists, academics, policymakers, and protected area managers to facilitate use.

From the information above, we can see that the map is a combination of satellite imagery and field data collection. It also relies on computer processing to accurately clean and render the data. In my opinion, the map is very well-produced and provides a lot of information.


__What technologies does the map use? I.e. Google maps, leaflet, mapbox, etc?__

The map uses mapbox and OpenStreetMap.

__If you could change something, what would it be?__

One thing that I might consider adding is pop up information about the selected regions so that people can learn more about the area they are looking at. I also find that the map shows pixelated color blocks when we zoom in to a certain level, which I think is not very aesthetically-pleasing and could be changed.
