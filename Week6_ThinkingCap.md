Before, when I think about mapping, I would always have this singular perspective that mapping is about converting data points to markers on a map, and that would be mapping. After taking GIS and Digital Humanities classes and reading _HyperCitie_, however, I realized that mapping is nowhere near singular. Personally, I really appreciate the idea of thick mapping because it is ever-changing, always evolving, and will not settle on one world view or one perspective. It is about giving voices to different groups of people based on their stories and narratives. Like described in the book, "thickness" is "a kind of analysis that is intrinsically incomplete, always under contestation, and never reaching any kind of final, underlying truth" (18). Specifically, the difference between thick mapping and mapping, according to the authors, is that "[t]hick maps are not simply 'more data' on maps, but interrogations of the very possibility of data, mapping, and cartographic representational practices" (19). 

In our world today, most of us acquire information online. And the online world is filled with propaganda, fake news, and manipulation. The concept of thick mapping, I believe, is very similar to critical thinking, although it might sound a bit clich√©. In particular, I think thick mapping is like critical thinking because it allows us to see beyond data and information and to look at different narratives and different ways of framing a narrative.
